# CET Tripos Tracker
Developed and written by Chi Ki Leung

The tripos trackers on this repository are designed for the University of Cambridge's Chemical Engineering Tripos. The tripos trackers can help to summarise tripos practice progress, organise learning points, review efficiently and identify next steps. I benefited hugely from developing and using the tripos tracker for my revision and I hope they can be of some use to you too.

This documentation provides a user guide and technical details to the tripos trackers, according to their three main sections: dashboard, tripos notes and general comments. The CET IIA tripos tracker is used as an example.
